WARNING

Please note: Due to the fact that OpenSocial at VZ is not yet 
productive, only the Sandbox Wrapper is kind of tested already. 
The others should work according to specs.


INSTALL

1) Download http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-php-client/
2) Place the Class in src/osapi/providers/
3) add 
	require_once "osapiVZProvider.php";
   to src/osapi/providers/osapiProvider.php

MINIHOWTO

* Check for valid authenticated request:

 	  http://developer.studivz.net/wiki/index.php/Gadgets.io_%28v0.8%29#Key_management_for_gadgets.io.AuthorizationType.SIGNED

   $oOsapiProvider is one of the vzProviders below - the right one is to be determined according
   to  $_GET['oauth_consumer_key'];
   At some later point in the future the correct one will be automatically chosen by osapiVZProvider,
   but the oauth_consumer_key values are not precisely specified at the time of writing, so please do
   it manually for now by initializing one of the four specific providers.

   $oRequest = OAuthRequest::from_request();
   $oSignatureMethod = $oOsapiProvider->getSignatureMethod();
   $bSignatueValid = $oSignatureMethod->check_signature($request, null, null, $_GET["oauth_signature"]);
